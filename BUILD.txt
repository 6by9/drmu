Compile is quite simple (Pi):

sudo apt install meson\
 libavutil-dev libavcodec-dev libavfilter-dev\
 libdrm-dev libxcb1-dev libxcb-randr0-dev libx11-dev\
 libx11-xcb-dev libxcb-dri3-dev
meson setup build
cd build
meson compile

This builds various executables

hello_drmu    A demo of how to use drmu to play video from libav*
              Very similar to my hello_drmprime project

resethdr      Trivial utility to reset HDR if it has become set and is burning
              your eyes

10bittest     Tries to set 10 bit mode and displays graduated colour bars
              Hit return to terminate

argbtest      Trivial test prog to check colour ordering in ARGB
